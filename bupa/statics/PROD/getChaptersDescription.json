Multiple procedures":"<strong>For consultants:</strong><br> <br>When clearly separate procedures have been performed on the same member, on the same day, in the same setting, Bupa benefits are calculated in the following way:<br><br>1<sup>st</sup> procedure = 100 percent reimbursement of the Bupa benefit limit for this procedure<br>2<sup>nd</sup> procedure = 50 percent of this procedure’s Bupa benefit limit<br><br>Benefit is payable for a maximum of two procedures where they are performed at the same time, or where it would have been medically appropriate to carry out these procedures during the same session. The highest classified procedure will be reimbursed at 100 percent of its Bupa benefit limit and the second procedure at 50 percent of its Bupa benefit limit.<br><br>Bupa may consider paying for three or more procedures in one surgical session in exceptional circumstances. This is decided on a case-by-case basis through the surgical uplift process (please refer to note 8.4 of these Essential Notes for further details).<br><br><strong>For hospitals:</strong><br><br>Unless the hospital agreement precludes additional charges for multiple procedures where more than one procedure is carried out, the theatre fee will be reimbursed at 100 percent of the most complex procedure and 50 percent of the next most complex procedure only.<br><br>The multiple procedure policy does not apply to incidental procedures performed at the same time as the main procedure, eg appendicectomy at the same time as hysterectomy (please refer to note 6 of these Essential Notes for further information).<br>","10. Procedures that may be restricted to specific criteria":"<span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The Schedule of Procedures contains a number of procedures that are not routinely eligible for Bupa reimbursement. This may be because the customer’s policy excludes certain treatments (eg cosmetic surgery), or because the procedure is part of a course of treatment that is currently limited to specific disease indications, treatment centres or consultant specialists. </span></span><br> <br><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">In some cases it may be appropriate for Bupa to fund a procedure that would not usually be eligible because it is part of a course of treatment that is eligible.

Please check that the customer has pre-authorised these procedures before treatment begins, as failure to do so may mean that Bupa will not reimburse your fees.

In particularly complicated cases or unusual circumstances, Bupa is prepared to consider an enhanced payment, please see note 8.4 for details.<br> \n<div><b>1.1 Consultations</b></div>\n\n<div> </div>\n\n<div>A consultation is defined as:</div>\n\n<div> </div>\n\n<div>A meeting between a patient and their consultant to evaluate the nature and progress of a condition (disease, illness or injury) and to establish a diagnosis, prognosis and treatment plan. A consultation should be carried out on a face-to-face basis and not remotely, unless the consultant is recognised to carry out remote consultations under the terms of their agreement with Bupa. <br><br><span style=\"font-family: arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Consultation fees are inclusive of any room charges. This means that Bupa does not pay additional fees for the use or hire of consultation rooms. </span></span><br> </div>\n\n<div><b>1.2 Consultations and procedures</b></div>\n\n<div> </div>\n\n<div>Bupa will fund eligible procedures carried out on the same day as an initial consultation. Bupa will not fund follow-up consultations carried out on the same day as most planned procedures. The procedure fee includes all component parts of that procedure including pre-operative assessment, the procedure itself and all routine aftercare, such as in-patient follow-up consultations and out-patient consultations on the same day.</div>\n\n<div> </div>\n\n<div>There are some exceptions where Bupa will fund follow-up consultations on the same day as planned procedures and these are identified in the Schedule by (ii). </div>\n\n<div> </div>\n\n<div>For example, a Bupa customer who requires the insertion of a Mirena coil will be covered for the initial consultation and the cost of the procedure. If the coil cannot be inserted on the day of the initial consultation, the procedure itself is funded separately, but a follow-up consultation will not be funded. </div>\n\n<div> </div>\n\n<div><b>1.3 In-patient care and consultations</b></div>\n\n<div> </div>\n\n<div>An initial in-patient consultation will be covered for eligible transfer from an emergency admission to private care, or when a consultant of a different medical specialty needs to review a patient.  </div>\n\n<div> </div>\n\n<div>Any subsequent claims for in-patient care should be made using procedure code 20320: Inpatient care. In-patient care is paid at a daily rate of £55 which includes the day of discharge. A supplement of £80 per night is available up to 14 nights per membership year for Major Medical Illness (MMI) (please see Appendix B for more information). Consultation procedure codes should not be used following the initial consultation until the patient has been discharged.</div>\n\n<div> </div>\n\n<div>When a patient needs to be admitted prior to surgery, the entire stay must be for eligible clinical reasons. In-patient care benefit is funded for any full day prior to surgery. After the surgery has been carried out, the cost of in-patient care benefit is included in the surgical benefit.</div>\n\n<div> </div>\n\n<div>When a customer remains in hospital longer than the average length of stay for that particular procedure, Bupa will consider requests for further in-patient benefit when supported by clinical justification for delaying the member’s discharge.

What happens when?":"<strong>8.1. ...I want to use an unproven technique or enter patients in a clinical trial?</strong><br><br>Bupa benefits do not cover unproven procedures or treatment. Use of non-licensed drugs is also excluded. We will, however, consider benefit in exceptional cases upon receipt of full clinical details.

Patients should be advised to contact Bupa to check their cover and warned of any likely shortfall. Please direct Bupa customers to call Member Services on 0845 609 0111. Calls may be recorded and may be monitored. If consultants wish to confirm a patient is covered, they should contact Bupa Provider Services on 08457 55 33 33. Lines are open 8am to 6pm Monday to Friday and 8am to 1pm on Saturday.

Consultants can therefore request surgical uplifts on a case-by-case basis for variations from the Schedule.<br><br><strong>Initial requests for surgical uplift</strong><br><br>Please call Bupa Provider Services on 08457 55 33 33 to log a request for a surgical uplift for procedures which are unusually complex.  Lines are open 8am to 6pm Monday to Friday and 8am to 1pm on Saturday. Calls may be recorded and may be monitored. <br><br><strong>Pre-operative surgical uplift requests</strong><br><br>These need to be made at least three working days before the scheduled date of treatment to enable us to review the rationale and make a funding decision.<br><br>Bupa recognises that it may not always be possible to submit a request at least three working days in advance. In such cases, we ask that consultants advise Bupa customers that the procedure being undertaken is at the customer’s own financial risk and that Bupa cannot guarantee that an uplift will be approved.<br><br>If you are asked by the Bupa Provider Services team to send supporting information, please include the following:<br><br>1.     lead surgeon’s name;<br>2.     name(s) of any additional surgeon(s), where the request is for multi-handed surgery, a clear description of the procedures the additional surgeon(s) will perform and the clinical rationale for why the lead surgeon cannot perform these;<br>3.     patient-specific complicating factors (eg co-morbidities, previous surgery etc);<br>4.     likely duration of surgery (best and worst case scenarios);<br>5.     Bupa procedure codes considered and why rejected;<br>6.     whether the requested procedure is carried out by the lead surgeon in his/her NHS practice and if not, why;<br>7.     supporting research evidence where treatments are new or novel; and<br>8.     a clear description of factors complicating anaesthesia (in addition to the above).<br><br><strong>Post-operative surgical uplift requests</strong><br><br>Bupa also recognises that not all surgical complications can be predicted and that, in some circumstances, consultants may need to make a post-operative surgical uplift request. To minimise anxiety for Bupa customers, we ask that consultants submit a post-operative surgical uplift request as soon as possible after the procedure has taken place and ensure that all clinicians (surgeons and anaesthetists) have agreed the surgical uplift(s) before these are submitted to Bupa.<br><br>If you are asked to provide supporting information for post-operative requests, please include all the points listed above for pre-operative surgical uplift requests and in addition:<br><br>1.     complicating factors found during surgery (eg unexpected adhesions, scar tissue or abnormal anatomy);<br>2.     complications arising during surgery (eg bleeding, tissue damage, perforation of viscus);<br>3.     anaesthetic or non-surgical complications (eg unplanned need for ventilation or by-pass);<br>4.     where possible, a description of the additional time taken in comparison to a routine procedure; and<br>5.     any other relevant supporting information.<br><br>The information Bupa requires to make a decision about pre and post-operative uplifts should be easily accessed from the customer’s out-patient consultation records, so Bupa does not make additional reimbursements for providing this information.<br><br>Ensuring that all the supporting documentation is available when requested will make the process as easy as possible. <br><br>Please do not use email to send patient-identifiable data as it is not necessarily a secure method of communication.<br><br>If you have any questions please call Bupa Provider Services on 08457 55 33 33.

Some examples of unbundling are:</span></span><br> <br><strong><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">When one procedure is already included in another </span></span></strong><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">– for example when an “introduction of Mirena coil” code is billed alongside a “hysteroscopy (including biopsy, dilatation, curettage and polypectomy +/- Mirena coil insertion)” code</span></span><br> <br><strong><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Impossible combinations</span></span></strong><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\"> – for example billing an “anaesthetic block of a major nerve trunk” code alongside a code for a procedure on a part of the body that has no major nerve trunk leading to it</span></span><br> <br><strong><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Highly similar/identical procedures </span></span></strong><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">– for example billing a code for laparoscopic surgery as well as a code for open surgery when only one method has been used</span></span><br> <br><strong><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">When a better code is available </span></span></strong><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">– for example billing separately for a hysterectomy and an oophorectomy when a “hysterectomy including oophorectomy” code can be used</span></span><br> <br><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">If an invoice containing an unbundled combination is received relating to the same member, on the same day, in the same setting, Bupa will only fund the highest value code in the unbundled combination.</span></span><br> <br><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The Clinical Coding &amp; Schedule Development (CCSD) Group defines the unbundling combinations which Bupa apply. From time to time, CCSD add and remove unbundling combinations and these are published in Bupa’s monthly Advance Notification of Changes to the Schedule of Procedures (<a href=\"http://www.bupa.co.uk/changes-to-schedule-of-procedures\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bupa.co.uk/changes-to-schedule-of-procedures</a>). Changes will come into effect for treatment which takes place on or after the date of the next Bupa Schedule of Procedures after they appear in the Advance Notification of Change document.</span></span><br> <br><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Unbundling combinations for each code can be found at: <a href=\"http://www.ccsd.org.uk/CCSDSchedule\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.ccsd.org.uk/CCSDSchedule</a>. To display a summary page about the code enter it in the “search schedule” box and click “go”. Clicking on the code while on the resulting page will display a list of “unacceptable combinations” for the code; these are the unbundling combinations.</span></span><br> <br><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Bupa applies all CCSD unbundling combinations on all codes contained in the schedule of procedures, there are no CCSD unbundling combinations that Bupa does not apply.  Bupa does not use any unbundling combinations which are not CCSD unbundling combinations.</span></span><br> <br><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Please contact CCSD (<a href=\"http://www.ccsd.org.uk/contactus\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.ccsd.org.uk/contactus</a>) if you have any queries about unbundling combinations, including requests for additions and removals.</span></span><br>","Grant of License":"<span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Bupa grants you a non-exclusive, royalty free, non-transferable, licence to use the CCSD Schedule only in the United Kingdom for the Purpose on the terms of this Licence.</span></span><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <br><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The rights granted hereunder are personal to you and that you do not have any rights to license, sub-license, sub-contract, assign, mortgage or otherwise transfer in whole or in part any of your rights granted under this Licence to any third party.</span></span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Subject to Clauses 5 and 6, you agree that the CCSD Schedule and all rights in it are the joint property of the current members of the CCSD Group from time to time and that you do not have any rights in or to the CCSD Schedule except as expressly set out hereunder.</span></span><br> <br><strong><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Your scope of use of the CCSD Schedule</span></span></strong><br> <br><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">You will use the CCSD Schedule only for the Purpose. </span></span><br> <br><span style=\"font-family: arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The CCSD Schedule may from time to time be updated by the CCSD Group.
